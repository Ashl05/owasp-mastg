## Getting the IPA File from an OTA Distribution Link

During development, apps are sometimes provided to testers via over-the-air (OTA) distribution. In that situation, you'll receive an itms-services link, such as the following:

```default
itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/test-uat/manifest.plist
```

You can use the [ITMS services asset downloader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/itms-services "ITMS services asset downloader") tool to download the IPA from an OTA distribution URL. Install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g itms-services
```

Save the IPA file locally with the following command:

```bash
# itms-services -u "itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/test-uat/manifest.plist" -o - > out.ipa
```

### Acquiring the App Binary

1. From an IPA:

   If you have the IPA (probably including an already decrypted app binary), unzip it and you are ready to go. The app binary is located in the main bundle directory (.app), e.g. `Payload/Telegram X.app/Telegram X`. See the following subsection for details on the extraction of the property lists.

    > On macOS's Finder, .app directories are opened by right-clicking them and selecting "Show Package Content". On the terminal you can just `cd` into them.

2. From a Jailbroken device:

    If you don't have the original IPA, then you need a jailbroken device where you will install the app (e.g. via App Store). Once installed, you need to extract the app binary from memory and rebuild the IPA file. Because of DRM, the app binary file is encrypted when it is stored on the iOS device, so simply pulling it from the Bundle (either through SSH or Objection) will not be sufficient to reverse engineer it.

The following shows the output of running [class-dump](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#class-dump) on the Telegram app, which was directly pulled from the installation directory of the iPhone:

```bash
$ class-dump Telegram

```

In order to retrieve the unencrypted version, you can use tools such as [frida-ios-dump](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump "frida-ios-dump") (all iOS versions) or [Clutch](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#clutch) (only up to iOS 11; for iOS 12 and above, it requires a patch). Both will extract the unencrypted version from memory while the application is running on the device. The stability of both Clutch and frida-ios-dump can vary depending on your iOS version and Jailbreak method, so it's useful to have multiple ways of extracting the binary.

>**IMPORTANT NOTE:** In the United States, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. 1201, or DMCA, makes it illegal and actionable to circumvent certain types of DRM. However, the DMCA also provides exemptions, such as for certain kinds of security research. A qualified attorney can help you determine if your research qualifies under the DMCA exemptions.

###### Using Clutch

Build [Clutch](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#clutch) as explained on the Clutch GitHub page and push it to the iOS device through `scp`. Run Clutch with the `-i` flag to list all installed applications:

```bash
root# ./Clutch -i
2019-06-04 20:16:57.807 Clutch[2449:440427] command: Prints installed applications
Installed apps:
...
5:   Telegram Messenger <ph.telegra.Telegraph>
...
```

Once you have the bundle identifier, you can use Clutch to create the IPA:

```bash
root# ./Clutch -d ph.telegra.Telegraph
2019-06-04 20:19:28.460 Clutch[2450:440574] command: Dump specified bundleID into .ipa file
ph.telegra.Telegraph contains watchOS 2 compatible application. It's not possible to dump watchOS 2 apps with Clutch (null) at this moment.

```

After copying the IPA file over to the host system and unzipping it, you can see that the Telegram app binary can now be parsed by [class-dump](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#class-dump), indicating that it is no longer encrypted:

```bash
$ class-dump Telegram
...

Note: when you use [Clutch](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#clutch) on iOS 12, please check [Clutch Github issue 228](https://github.com/KJCracks/Clutch/issues/228 "Getting Clutch to run on iOS 12")

###### Using Frida-ios-dump

First, make sure that the configuration in [Frida-ios-dump](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#frida-ios-dump) `dump.py` is set to either localhost with port 2222 when using [iproxy](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#iproxy), or to the actual IP address and port of the device from which you want to dump the binary. Next, change the default username (`User = 'root'`) and password (`Password = 'alpine'`) in `dump.py` to the ones you use.

Now you can safely use the tool to enumerate the apps installed:

```bash
$ python dump.py -l
 PID  Name             Identifier
----  ---------------  -------------------------------------
 860  Cydia            com.saurik.Cydia
1130  Settings         com.apple.Preferences
 685  Mail             com.apple.mobilemail
 834  Telegram         ph.telegra.Telegraph
   -  Stocks           com.apple.stocks
   ...
```

and you can dump one of the listed binaries:

```bash
$ python dump.py ph.telegra.Telegraph

Start the target app ph.telegra.Telegraph

```

After this, the `Telegram.ipa` file will be created in your current directory. You can validate the success of the dump by removing the app and reinstalling it (e.g. using [ios-deploy](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#ios-deploy) `ios-deploy -b Telegram.ipa`). Note that this will only work on jailbroken devices, as otherwise the signature won't be valid.
