title: Extracting Information From Application Binary
---

You can use [class-dump](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#class-dump) to get information about methods in the application's source code. The example below uses the [Damn Vulnerable iOS App](0x08b-Reference-Apps.md#dvia-v2) to demonstrate this. Our binary is a so-called fat binary, which means that it can be executed on 32- and 64-bit platforms:

Unzip the app and run [otool](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#otool):

```bash
unzip DamnVulnerableiOSApp.ipa
cd Payload/DamnVulnerableIOSApp.app
otool -hv DamnVulnerableIOSApp
```

The output will look like this:

```bash
DamnVulnerableIOSApp (architecture armv7):
Mach header
      magic  cputype cpusubtype  caps    filetype ncmds sizeofcmds      flags
   MH_MAGIC      ARM         V7  0x00     EXECUTE    33       3684   NOUNDEFS DYLDLINK TWOLEVEL PIE
DamnVulnerableIOSApp (architecture arm64):
Mach header
      magic  cputype cpusubtype  caps    filetype ncmds sizeofcmds      flags
MH_MAGIC_64    ARM64        ALL  0x00     EXECUTE    33       4192   NOUNDEFS DYLDLINK TWOLEVEL PIE
```

Note the architectures: `armv7` (32-bit) and `arm64` (64-bit). This design of a fat binary allows an application to be deployed on different architectures.
To analyze the application with class-dump, we must create a so-called thin binary, which contains one architecture only:

```bash
lipo -thin armv7 DamnVulnerableIOSApp -output DVIA32
```

And then we can proceed to performing class-dump:

```bash
iOS8-jailbreak:~ root# class-dump DVIA32

@interface FlurryUtil : ./DVIA/DVIA/DamnVulnerableIOSApp/DamnVulnerableIOSApp/YapDatabase/Extensions/Views/Internal/
{
}
+ (BOOL)appIsCracked;
+ (BOOL)deviceIsJailbroken;
```

Note the plus sign, which means that this is a class method that returns a BOOL type.
A minus sign would mean that this is an instance method. Refer to later sections to understand the practical difference between these.

> Some commercial disassemblers (such as [Hopper](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#hopper-commercial-tool) execute these steps automatically, and you'd be able to see the disassembled binary and class information.

The following command is listing shared libraries:

```bash
otool -L <binary>
```
