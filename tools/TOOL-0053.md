[Frida-ios-dump](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump "Frida-ios-dump") is a Python script that helps you retrieve the decrypted version of an iOS app (IPA) from an iOS device. It supports both Python 2 and Python 3 and requires Frida running on your iOS device (jailbroken or not). This tool uses Frida's [Memory API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#memory "Frida Memory API") to dump the memory of the running app and recreate an IPA file. Because the code is extracted from memory, it is automatically decrypted. Please refer to the section ["Using Frida-ios-dump"](#using-frida-ios-dump "Using Frida-ios-dump") for detailed instructions on how to use it.
